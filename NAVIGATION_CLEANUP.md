  const FeaturedScreen(),    // ❌ Dummy screen
  const ProfileScreen(),     // ✅ Keep
];
```

final List<Widget> _screens = [
  const ExploreScreen(),     // ✅ Venue discovery & search

  const TeamsScreen(),       // ✅ Team creation & matchmaking
  const ChallengesScreen(),  // ✅ Tournaments & challenges
  const ProfileScreen(),     // ✅ User profile & settings
